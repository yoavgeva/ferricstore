defmodule Ferricstore.Jepsen.AsyncDurabilityTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Jepsen-style async durability tests from test plan Section 19.7.

  Verifies durability guarantees under `:async` namespace durability mode.
  In async mode, writes are ACKed after the leader WAL fdatasync only --
  replication to followers is not guaranteed before ACK. The durability
  contract:

    * Leader restart (crash + recover same node): ACKed writes survive
      because the WAL was fsynced before ACK.
    * Leader kill (process terminated, no restart): writes may be lost if
      replication had not completed before the kill. This is the documented
      async data loss window and is expected per spec.

  ## Architecture note

  In single-node Raft mode, each node is its own independent cluster with
  self-quorum. Async durability bypasses Raft consensus and writes directly
  to Bitcask + ETS via the AsyncApplyWorker. After a node restart, the
  Bitcask WAL (which was fsynced) ensures the data survives.
