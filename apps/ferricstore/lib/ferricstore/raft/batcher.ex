defmodule Ferricstore.Raft.Batcher do
  @moduledoc """
  Namespace-aware group commit batcher for a single FerricStore shard.

  Per spec sections 2C.5 and 2F.3, each shard has its own Batcher GenServer
  that accumulates write commands into per-namespace buffers, each with its
  own commit window and durability mode. When a namespace's timer fires, only
  that namespace's buffer is flushed.

  ## How it works

  1. A client calls `write/2` which sends a `GenServer.call` to the batcher.
  2. The batcher extracts the key's namespace prefix (e.g. `"session"` from
     `"session:abc123"`, `"_root"` for keys without a colon).
  3. The namespace config is looked up from the `:ferricstore_ns_config` ETS
     table to determine `window_ms` and `durability` for this prefix.
  4. The command and caller are appended to the namespace's buffer slot,
     identified by `{prefix, durability}`.
  5. On the first write to an empty slot, a timer is started using the
     namespace's `window_ms`.
  6. When the timer fires (`:flush_slot`), only that slot's commands are
     submitted to Raft via `ra:pipeline_command/3`.
  7. Each caller receives their individual result from the batch once the
     ra command commits and the batcher receives the `ra_event` notification.

  ## Pipelined ra submission (non-blocking)

  To avoid serializing all writers through one GenServer while the previous
  batch is in-flight through Raft consensus, the batcher uses
  `ra:pipeline_command/3` instead of the blocking `ra:process_command/2`.

  `pipeline_command` is a cast -- it returns immediately with `:ok`, and
  the batcher receives an async `{ra_event, Leader, {applied, [...]}}` message
  when the command is committed and applied by the state machine.

  The batcher maintains a `pending` map keyed by correlation reference, which
  maps each in-flight batch to the list of callers (`froms`) that are waiting
  for a reply. When the `ra_event` arrives, the batcher extracts the result
  and calls `GenServer.reply/2` for each caller.

  This means the GenServer never blocks on Raft. During the time a batch is
  in-flight, the batcher continues to accept new writes and accumulate them
  into fresh slots. This eliminates the throughput bottleneck where 50 writers
  were serialized through one blocked GenServer.

  ## Namespace configuration

  Per-prefix configuration is originally sourced from the `:ferricstore_ns_config`
  ETS table managed by `Ferricstore.NamespaceConfig`. To avoid two ETS lookups
  (~400ns) on every write, the batcher caches namespace config in its process
  state (`ns_cache`). The first write for a given prefix fetches from ETS and
  caches the result; subsequent writes for the same prefix use the cached
  value with zero ETS overhead.

  When namespace config changes (via `FERRICSTORE.CONFIG SET` or `RESET`),
  `NamespaceConfig` broadcasts `:ns_config_changed` to all batcher processes,
  which clears their caches. The next write for any prefix then re-reads
  from ETS.

  If no configuration exists for a prefix, the defaults are used:
  `window_ms = 1`, `durability = :quorum`.

  For `:quorum` durability, commands are submitted to ra via
  `:ra.pipeline_command/3` with a correlation reference. Callers are replied to
  when the `ra_event` notification arrives confirming the command was applied.

  For `:async` durability (spec 2F.3), there are two entry points:

  - `Batcher.async_submit/2` (preferred) is called by `Router.async_write_*`
    after Router has already persisted locally (ETS + Bitcask for big values).
    Commands accumulate in a dedicated `{prefix, :async_origin}` slot and
    flush as one `ra.pipeline_command({:batch, [{:async, cmd}, ...]})` for
    replication. The state machine's `{:async, inner}` clause origin-skips
    on the node that already has the ETS entry. No callers to reply to —
    Router already returned `:ok` to its caller.

  - `Batcher.write/2` on an async namespace (legacy callers) is the blocking
    entry; the caller is replied `:ok` immediately when the slot is flushed,
    commands go to Raft as a regular `{:batch, [cmds]}` (no `{:async, ...}`
    wrapper) and the state machine applies them normally on every node.

  ## Why a separate GenServer?

  The batcher is intentionally separate from the Shard GenServer and the
  ra state machine. This separation keeps the batching logic independent
  of the consensus layer and allows the Shard to remain focused on read
  operations and ETS management.

  ## Configuration

    * `:shard_index` (required) -- zero-based shard index
