defmodule Ferricstore.CrossShardOp.IntentResolver do
  @moduledoc """
  Resolves stale intents left by crashed cross-shard operation coordinators.

  On startup (or on-demand), scans all shards for intent records with
  status `:executing`. For each stale intent:

    * Checks if the intent is old enough to be considered stale (>10s)
    * Reads current state of involved keys
    * Compares value hashes with `:erlang.phash2/1`
    * If hash matches: data unchanged, safe to clean up the intent
    * If hash doesn't match: someone wrote new data, clean up intent (don't re-execute)
    * If key doesn't exist: already completed or expired, clean up intent

  Intent records are self-describing: they contain the command type, involved
  keys, and expected value hashes.
