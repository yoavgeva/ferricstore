defmodule Ferricstore.Jepsen.SetDurabilityTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Jepsen-style set durability tests from test plan Section 19.5.

  SADD members that were ACKed must always be in SMEMBERS after any fault.
  This is the Jepsen set test -- one of the clearest correctness checks
  because set membership is unambiguous: a member is either present or it
  is not.

  In single-node Raft mode (current architecture), each node is independent.
  Set operations are local. The test verifies:

    1. ACKed SADD members survive sibling node crashes.
    2. No phantom members appear (members that were never ACKed).
    3. After multiple rounds of node kills, all ACKed members are still present.

  When multi-node Raft is implemented, these tests will validate that SADD
  is durable across the cluster and survives leader failover.
