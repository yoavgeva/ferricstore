defmodule Ferricstore.Jepsen.LostWritesTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Jepsen-style lost write tests from test plan Section 19.2.

  Tests the fundamental durability guarantee: when FerricStore acknowledges a
  write, that write must survive node crashes. In single-node Raft mode (current
  architecture), each node is its own independent Raft cluster with self-quorum.
  The durability guarantee is: if `FerricStore.set/2` returns `:ok`, the data was
  committed to the local Raft log and applied to Bitcask. It must survive:

    1. Sibling node crashes (trivial -- independent nodes)
    2. The writing node staying alive while others crash
    3. Multiple rounds of node kills

  When multi-node Raft is implemented, these tests will validate cross-node
  quorum durability: ACK means committed on 2/3 nodes before response.
