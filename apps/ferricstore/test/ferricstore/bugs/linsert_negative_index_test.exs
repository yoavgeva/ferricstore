defmodule Ferricstore.Bugs.LinsertNegativeIndexTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Regression test for Bug #1: LINSERT position calculation issues.

  The LINSERT BEFORE/AFTER implementation computes new positions as the
  midpoint between adjacent elements. When many elements are inserted at
  the same position (e.g., repeatedly LINSERT BEFORE the same pivot),
  the midpoint positions converge toward each other and eventually collide
  due to float64 precision limits (related to Bug #5: position encoding
  precision loss).

  The position calculation at list_ops.ex:316 also has a latent bug where
  `Enum.at(sorted, idx - 1)` with idx=0 would use Elixir negative indexing
  to access the last element. Currently guarded by `if idx == 0`, but the
  midpoint-based position scheme breaks down under sustained insertions.
