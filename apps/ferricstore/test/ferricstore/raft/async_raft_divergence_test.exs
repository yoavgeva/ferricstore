defmodule Ferricstore.Raft.AsyncRaftDivergenceTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Tests proving that async writes that fail to reach Raft are permanently
  divergent — the local node has the data but Raft never does.

  This validates the reviewer's concern: `async_submit_to_raft/2` uses
  `ra.pipeline_command/2` (no correlation) with `catch :exit, _ -> :ok`,
  meaning failed submissions are silently dropped. The local ETS + Bitcask
  have the data, but the Raft log doesn't, creating permanent inconsistency.

  In single-node mode, this manifests after snapshot + WAL truncation:
  the Raft state machine snapshot won't include the async-only write,
  and if the old WAL segments are cleaned up, the data exists only in
  Bitcask (recovered on restart via keydir rebuild) but not in the Raft
  state machine's view.
