defmodule Ferricstore.Raft.NativeEdgeCasesTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Edge-case tests for native commands (CAS, LOCK, RATELIMIT.ADD) routed
  through the Raft write path, plus concurrency tests that prove Raft
  serialization provides correct atomic semantics.

  These tests exercise the full Raft pipeline: Router -> Shard -> Batcher ->
  ra -> StateMachine -> ETS + Bitcask. The Raft infrastructure is set up in
  `setup_all` following the same pattern as `WritePathTest`.

  ## Test groups

    1. CAS edge cases -- TTL propagation, expiry semantics, concurrency,
       empty-string vs nil distinction.
    2. LOCK edge cases -- expired key acquisition, owner re-acquire with TTL
       update, multi-owner conflict, wrong-owner unlock, extend on unlocked.
    3. RATELIMIT.ADD edge cases -- window rollover, rapid calls, bulk count,
       independent keys, zero-window edge case.
    4. Concurrent Raft writes -- INCR, CAS, LOCK, LPUSH under concurrency to
       prove Raft serialization delivers correct atomic semantics.
