defmodule Ferricstore.Raft.BatcherAsyncRetryTest do
  @moduledoc """
  TDD tests for Option R1 async retry-on-rejection (see design discussion
  in docs/async-rmw-design.md §"Rejected-ra retry" and async-write-redesign).

  The Batcher submits async batches via `ra.pipeline_command`. If Ra
  responds with `:rejected {:not_leader, hint, corr}` (leader change
  during submission), the Batcher must:

  - Retry once to the hinted leader (or same shard if hint is :undefined)
    up to @max_async_retries times.
  - Emit [:ferricstore, :batcher, :async_retry] telemetry on each retry.
  - After max retries, drop the batch and emit
    [:ferricstore, :batcher, :async_dropped] with reason :max_retries.
  - Sweep pending entries older than the TTL; drop with reason :ttl.

  These tests drive the implementation by asserting the observable
  behaviors above. They don't need a live Ra cluster — we inject synthetic
  `:ra_event` messages into a running Batcher and assert telemetry fires
  with the expected metadata.
