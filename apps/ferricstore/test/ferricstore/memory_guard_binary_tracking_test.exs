  Tests that keydir binary memory tracking accurately accounts for

  :ets.info(:memory) only counts tuple overhead and small inlined binaries.
  Binaries > 64 bytes are stored off-heap as refc binaries and NOT counted.
  The keydir_binary_bytes atomics counter tracks these to give MemoryGuard
  accurate memory accounting.
