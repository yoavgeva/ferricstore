      # These fields are NEVER updated. There is no Raft command to update

      # only updates:
      #   1. Its own Shard GenServer state
      #   2. ActiveFile.publish (persistent_term/ETS for Router's async path)
      #
      # It does NOT notify the ra state machine.

      #   NIF.v2_append_batch_nosync(state.active_file_path, batch)

      # And at line 1226 uses state.active_file_id:
      #   :ets.update_element(state.ets, key, [{5, state.active_file_id}, ...])
      #
      # HOWEVER: In practice, this may not be a critical bug in single-node mode
      # because:
      #
      # 1. maybe_rotate_file is called from Shard's handle_call/handle_cast
      #    for direct writes (not Raft path). The Raft state machine has its
      #    own write path that goes through flush_pending_writes.
      #
      # 2. The file rotation happens when active_file_size exceeds the max.
      #    The Shard tracks active_file_size based on its OWN writes, not the
      #    state machine's writes.
      #
      # 3. In the Raft path (quorum writes), the state machine always writes
      #    to state.active_file_path. The Shard may rotate its file, but
      #    the state machine continues writing to the old file. This means:
      #    - The "old" file keeps growing beyond max_active_file_size
      #    - ETS entries get the old file_id even for new writes
      #    - On restart, the old file is correctly read (data isn't lost)
      #    - But compaction/merge may not work correctly because it expects
      #      the active file to be the latest one
      #
      # 4. In multi-node mode, this is worse: the Shard on the leader node
      #    may rotate, but the state machine on follower nodes still has the
      #    ORIGINAL file_id/path from init. After a snapshot restore, the
      #    follower would try to write to a file that may not exist.
      #
      # WAIT: actually let me re-check. The shard only rotates via direct
      # write path. When quorum_write is used, writes go through ra:pipeline_command
      # which goes to the state machine. The shard's active_file_size may not
      # increase from these writes because the state machine writes directly.
      # So rotation may never trigger for the Raft write path.
      #
      # But the state machine DOES write to the file (flush_pending_writes),
      # and the file grows. Nobody tracks this growth or triggers rotation
      # for the state machine's file. The file just keeps growing.
