  D1: Verifies that System.os_time(:millisecond) is used inside apply/3's
  call chain, violating Raft's determinism contract.

  The ra meta map provides `system_time` (millisecond) which is captured
  once when the leader receives the command and stored in the Raft log,
  making it identical on every replica. The state machine should use
  meta[:system_time] instead of System.os_time(:millisecond).
