  # R2-C4: GEOSEARCH BYBOX incorrect distance calculation
  #
  # The bug: in_shape?/6 for BYBOX computes dx (east-west distance) using
  # haversine(center_lat, center_lng, center_lat, member_lng). This measures
  # longitude distance along the center's latitude. For members at a very
  # different latitude, 1 degree of longitude spans a different number of
  # meters, so the box boundary check can include/exclude points incorrectly.
  #
  # At high latitudes, 1 degree of longitude is much shorter than at the
  # equator. A box centered at 60N with a given width_m should exclude a
  # point that is just outside the box edge. But because dx is computed at
  # center_lat (60N) while the point may be at a different latitude, the
  # measured dx is wrong.
