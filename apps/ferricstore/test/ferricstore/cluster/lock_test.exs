defmodule Ferricstore.Cluster.LockTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Distributed lock cluster tests from test plan Section 13.

  Verifies lock semantics across multiple FerricStore peer nodes:

  - LOCK acquired on one node is visible on that node (Raft-durable)
  - Concurrent LOCK attempts on the same node: exactly 1 winner
  - LOCK survives node restart (Raft WAL persistence)
  - UNLOCK from wrong owner fails

  ## Current Architecture Note

  Each node currently runs as an independent single-node Raft cluster.
  Lock operations are tested per-node. When multi-node Raft is added,
  the "lock visible on all nodes" tests will validate cross-node lock
  replication.
