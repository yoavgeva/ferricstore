# FerricStore Throughput Optimization Guide (v0.2.0)

Each section has: current default, what to benchmark, expected tradeoff.

## Write Path Architecture (v0.2.0)

Understanding the write path is essential before tuning:

```
Client SET key value
  → Router.put()
    → check_keydir_full() (atomics, ~5ns)
    → ra:process_command(reply_from: :local)
      → WAL write (page cache, async fdatasync)
      → Raft commit (single-node: immediate)
      → state_machine apply/3
        → v2_append_batch_nosync() (Bitcask, page cache)
        → v2_fsync() (one fsync per batch)
        → ETS insert
      → reply :ok to caller
```

**Two fsyncs per write path:**
1. **WAL fdatasync** — async, batched by our patched ra_log_wal
2. **Bitcask fsync** — sync, one per Raft batch (group commit)

The Bitcask fsync is the new bottleneck (added in v0.2.0 for crash
durability). It's amortized: the Raft batcher groups N writes into one
`:batch` command → one `v2_append_batch_nosync` → one `v2_fsync`.

**Measured:** 20 writes batched = 4ms (1 fsync). 20 individual = 84ms
(20 fsyncs). **20x speedup from batching.**

### Quorum vs Async paths

| Path | Raft | Bitcask fsync | Durability |
|------|------|---------------|------------|
| Quorum | `process_command(reply_from: :local)` — waits for local apply | Yes (per batch) | Crash-safe |
| Async | ETS + Bitcask first, then `pipeline_command` fire-and-forget | No | Page cache only |

Async writes are ~10-50x faster but can lose data on crash (up to
one fsync interval of writes). Use for caches, rate limiters, sessions.

## Tunable Parameters (need benchmarking)

### 1. Raft Batcher Window

**Current:** Configurable per namespace via `window_ms` (default varies).

The batcher collects writes over a time window, then submits them as a
single `{:batch, commands}` to Raft. The state machine applies all
commands and does ONE fsync for the entire batch.

**This is the most important tunable for quorum write throughput.**

```
window_ms=1   → batch of ~10-50 writes  → 1 fsync  → low latency, lower throughput
window_ms=5   → batch of ~50-500 writes → 1 fsync  → balanced
window_ms=10  → batch of ~500+ writes   → 1 fsync  → high throughput, higher tail latency
```

**What to benchmark:**
- Throughput at window_ms 1, 2, 5, 10, 20
- p50/p95/p99 latency at each window
- Optimal: highest throughput where p99 < your SLA

**Tradeoff:** Longer window = more writes per fsync = higher throughput,
but p99 latency increases by ~window_ms.

### 2. WAL fdatasync (automatic, self-tuning)

**Current:** Async fdatasync in patched ra_log_wal. While fdatasync is
in flight (~100μs NVMe, ~1-5ms SSD), new writes accumulate. When it
completes, all accumulated writers are notified, then another fdatasync
starts.

The "batch window" IS the fdatasync latency. No explicit tunable — the
faster the disk, the smaller the batch. NVMe is ~10x faster than SSD
here.

**What to benchmark:**
- NVMe vs SSD throughput difference (expected: 3-10x)
- How many writes accumulate per fdatasync cycle

**Tradeoff:** Self-tuning. Storage medium is the only variable.

### 3. Shard Count

**Current:** `4` (default), configurable via `FERRICSTORE_SHARD_COUNT`.
If set to `0`, defaults to `System.schedulers_online()`.

Each shard has an independent Raft group + WAL + Bitcask file + fsync.
More shards = more PARALLEL fsyncs = higher aggregate write throughput.

**This is the second most important tunable for write throughput.**

```
4 shards on 4 cores   → 4 parallel fsyncs  → ~40K writes/sec (NVMe)
8 shards on 4 cores   → 8 parallel fsyncs  → ~70K writes/sec (NVMe)
16 shards on 4 cores  → 16 parallel fsyncs → ~100K writes/sec (NVMe)
32 shards on 4 cores  → diminishing returns, more memory overhead
```

**What to benchmark:**
- `schedulers_online()` (1:1 with cores)
- `schedulers_online() * 2` (2:1, more parallelism for NVMe)
- `schedulers_online() * 4` (4:1, diminishing returns?)
- Measure write AND read throughput (reads may degrade with many shards)

**Tradeoff:** More shards = more write parallelism but:
- More ETS tables = less CPU cache locality for reads
- MGET across shards hits multiple tables
- More file descriptors and memory overhead per shard
- Each shard's Raft state machine is a separate process

The sweet spot depends on read/write ratio. Write-heavy: more shards.
Read-heavy: fewer shards.

### 4. Socket Active Mode

**Current:** `active: 100` — kernel delivers up to 100 TCP messages
before going passive. Re-arms on `{:tcp_passive, _}`.

**What to benchmark:**
- `active: true` — no back-pressure, highest throughput, risk of mailbox flood
- `active: 50` — less kernel overhead than 100
- `active: 200` — more batching per passive cycle
- `active: :once` — lowest throughput, best back-pressure

**Tradeoff:** Higher N = fewer `setopts` syscalls = higher throughput,
but larger mailbox under slow consumers.

### 5. Hot Cache Max Value Size

**Current:** `65_536` (64KB). Values larger than this are stored as
`nil` in ETS (cold). Reads go to Bitcask NIF pread.

**What to benchmark:**
- Lower (16KB, 32KB) — less ETS memory, more cold reads
- Higher (128KB, 256KB) — more ETS memory, fewer cold reads
- Measure with your actual value size distribution

**Tradeoff:** Larger threshold = more RAM used by ETS hot cache, but
fewer disk reads. Off-heap binary tracking makes MemoryGuard accurate
regardless.

### 6. Max Active File Size (Bitcask)

**Current:** `256MB`. When active file exceeds this, it rolls over.

**What to benchmark:**
- Smaller (64MB, 128MB) — more frequent rollovers, more compaction
- Larger (512MB, 1GB) — fewer rollovers, larger sequential writes

**Tradeoff:** Smaller files = more compaction I/O but less wasted space.
Larger files = less overhead but slower recovery on restart.

### 7. Release Cursor Interval (Raft Snapshots)

**Current:** `100` — every 100 applied commands, ra may snapshot.

**What to benchmark:**
- Lower (50) — more frequent snapshots, faster recovery, more I/O
- Higher (500, 1000) — less snapshot overhead, slower recovery

**Tradeoff:** More snapshots = faster restart but more CPU/IO during
normal operation.

## Fixed Settings (already optimized, just enable)

### BEAM VM Flags

```bash
# vm.args — add all of these
+sbt db           # scheduler pinning → 10-20% throughput gain
+sbwt very_short  # ~1µs wakeup vs ~100µs
+swt very_low     # wake idle schedulers immediately
+K true           # epoll/kqueue
+P 5000000        # max processes
+Q 65536          # max ports
+A 128            # async threads for disk reads
+MHas aoffcbf     # heap allocator strategy
+MBas aoffcbf     # binary allocator strategy
```

### OS Tuning

```bash
# Huge pages — critical for large ETS
echo 'vm.nr_hugepages = 1024' >> /etc/sysctl.conf

# Never swap
echo 'vm.swappiness = 1' >> /etc/sysctl.conf

# Disable THP (causes latency spikes)
echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled

# NVMe — bypass block layer
echo none > /sys/block/nvme0n1/queue/scheduler
echo 1024 > /sys/block/nvme0n1/queue/nr_requests

# File descriptors
echo '* soft nofile 1048576' >> /etc/security/limits.conf

# CPU governor
cpupower frequency-set -g performance
```

### NUMA (multi-socket)

```bash
# Pin BEAM to one NUMA node
numactl --cpubind=0 --membind=0 ./ferricstore start
```

---

## Application-Level Optimizations

### Embedded mode vs TCP

```
embedded:   ETS lookup → ~1-5µs per read
TCP/RESP3:  syscall + parse + ETS → ~50-300µs per read
```

If your app runs on the same BEAM node, use the embedded API.

### Pipelining (TCP clients)

```
# Without pipelining: 3 round-trips
SET k1 v1 → OK → SET k2 v2 → OK → SET k3 v3 → OK

# With pipelining: 1 round-trip, commands batch into one Raft batch
SET k1 v1 \r\n SET k2 v2 \r\n SET k3 v3 → OK OK OK
```

Pipelined commands arrive in the same TCP read, get dispatched together,
and land in the same Raft batcher slot → one batch → one fsync.

### MULTI/EXEC

```
MULTI → SET k1 v1 → SET k2 v2 → SET k3 v3 → EXEC
= 1 Raft round-trip + 1 fsync instead of 3
```

### Data modeling — fewer keys

```
3 keys (3 keydir entries):  SET user:42:name, SET user:42:email, SET user:42:country
1 key (1 keydir entry):     HSET user:42 name email country
```

Fewer keys = smaller keydir = better TLB hit rate = faster everything.

### Raw binary storage (embedded mode)

```elixir
# Skip JSON — store Erlang terms directly
FerricStore.set("key", :erlang.term_to_binary(term))
term = :erlang.binary_to_term(FerricStore.get("key"))
```

## Expected Numbers (to verify with benchmarks)

Based on the architecture, expected single-node throughput on NVMe:

| Workload | Shards | Expected ops/sec | Bottleneck |
|----------|--------|-----------------|------------|
| Read-only (ETS hot) | 4 | 500K-1M+ | CPU/scheduler |
| Read-only (cold, pread) | 4 | 100-200K | NVMe IOPS |
| Write quorum (batched) | 4 | 30-50K | fsync latency |
| Write quorum (batched) | 16 | 80-120K | fsync parallelism |
| Write async | 4 | 200-500K | CPU/ETS |
| Mixed 80/20 read/write | 8 | 100-200K | balanced |

Redis 7 single-threaded: ~100-160K SET/sec. Dragonfly multi-threaded:
~1M+ SET/sec. Our target: competitive with Redis on quorum writes,
faster on reads (ETS hot cache).

## Benchmarking Methodology

For each tunable, run:

```bash
# Baseline (4 shards, default batcher)
memtier_benchmark -s 127.0.0.1 -p 6379 --ratio=1:0 -n 100000 -c 50 -t 4

# Change one variable
FERRICSTORE_SHARD_COUNT=16 mix run --no-halt &
memtier_benchmark -s 127.0.0.1 -p 6379 --ratio=1:0 -n 100000 -c 50 -t 4
```

Measure:
- **Throughput**: ops/sec (writes and reads separately)
- **Latency**: p50, p95, p99 in microseconds
- **Memory**: RSS, ETS memory, binary bytes tracked
- **Disk I/O**: IOPS, bandwidth (iostat -x 1)

Compare against baseline. Change one variable at a time.
Run each config 3 times and take the median.
